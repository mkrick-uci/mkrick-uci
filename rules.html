	PLACEHOLDER TEXT
The basic rules of Tile Control are relatively simple. It should be kept in mind that units may be heavily changed over the course of development. Players are given a 8-by-8 square board of empty tiles at the beginning of the game. Players take their turns simultaneously on a timer dictated by the program. During this point, players have their screen hidden from each other. This part of each turn will from now on be called the “planning phase.” Each planning phase, the players are given an amount of currency that scales the number of turns, which they use to place units on the edges of the board. Each individual unit costs a certain amount of this currency to place on the board. Each unit has a number associated with it, that indicates its strength. A few units also have additional effects that will be available to the players within the program. If they still have units from previous turns, they can move the unit one square in any cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) each turn. Once the timer is up, both players reveal their screens to one another. Each player’s board actually represents the same board, and any overlapping units need to fight. The unit with the higher strength stays on the board, while the weaker one is removed. Like with many other board games, the abilities of each unit and other units may affect the outcomes of fights. While most units are meant to fight other units, some units are stationary and will automatically lose a fight. However, these types of units, called buildings, can have a friendly unit on top of it. This unit can essentially “guard” the building from attackers. These buildings grant extra benefits, such as extra income, increased strength for certain units, etc. After 20 turns, the game ends, and the player with the highest cumulative strength of all their units is the winner.
